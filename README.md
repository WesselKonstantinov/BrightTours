# Bright Tours - Travel agency website
A basic static website of a fictional travel agency called 'Bright Tours'.

## Overview
- I created this site using semantic HTML and Sass.
- It consists of multiple pages:
    - a homepage 
    - an about page 
    - a contact page
    - four destination pages (Japan, Bulgaria, Suriname and Egypt)
- Its design is responsive.
- It can be found [here](https://wesselkonstantinov.github.io/BrightTours/).
